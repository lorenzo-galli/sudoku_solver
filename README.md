# Sudoku Solver

This is a project I developed to practice my python skills and to test them. This is beginner level program so I know there is a lot of room for improvement and tweaks but it was just made for practice so I'll leave it like this.

For this project was used the pygame library to display the board and pure python to handle the checks and algorithms. 

Hope you'll like it ;)

## How to play
Just run the python file with pygame installed. To solve the sudoku press the space bar. 

To select a tile just click it with the mouse or use the arrow keys / WASD.

To mark a tile just press a number from (1 to 9). 

Use the backspace key to delete the number.
